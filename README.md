## About The Project

![Lot Editor Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

<p align="justify"><strong>Lot Editor</strong> is a simple 3D Sims-style... well, lot editor. Here's what you can do:</p>

- <strong>Build and delete walls</strong>
- <strong>Place doors on walls</strong>
- <strong>Place and delete furniture</strong>
- <strong>Colour both walls and furniture</strong>
- <strong>Save and load your lots</strong>

Here's <em>how</em> to do it:

- Press `F1` to enter Build Mode. While in build mode, click and hold down the left mouse button to build the walls. They won't be placed on the lot until you've released the left mouse button. You can press the `Delete` button to go into delete mode. You can delete walls (including door walls) by pointing at a wall and clicking it.
- Press `F2` to enter Furniture Mode. While in furniture mode, click on a location with the left mouse button to place the furniture. You can change which furniture you want by clicking the buttons at the bottom. You can press the `Delete` button to go into delete mode. You can delete furniture by pointing at them and clicking them.
- Press `F3` to enter Door Mode. While in door mode, click on a wall with the left mouse button to place a door on the wall.
- Press `F4` to enter Colour Mode. While in colour mode, you can click on a wall, a door, or an object/piece of furniture and change the colour using the colour picker on the top right.
- Press `Escape` to quit the lot editor.
- Press the `Save` button on the bottom left to save your current layout.
- Press the `Load` button on the bottom left to load a layout.
